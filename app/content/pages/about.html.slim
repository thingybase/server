        | It all started in 2018 a few weeks before our second daughter was born. Our family loves to cook, and we were cooking like mad to stock up a bunch of freezer meals for the first few weeks of our second child's life. As I was labeling all of our food to put into the freezer, I found myself thinking, "there has to be a better way to do this!"

      h2.title.is-5 Label makers suck

      p
        | I should be able to use my phone to make labels instead of a junky little stand-alone label maker with a weird keyboard and even weirder cartridges. I knew about <%= link_to "wireless thermal label printers", page_path("help/printers") %> and thought, "wouldn't it be cool if I could easily make labels with one of those?"

      h2.title.is-5 I should have a search engine for my stuff

      p
        | If I'm going through the trouble of printing a label from my phone, why can't I store that fact somewhere electronically so I can search it later to see what I've got? There's so many amazing things that I can do by simply storing this stuff in a database that I can access from home or on the go.

      h2.title.is-5 My family should be able to search through our stuff

      p
        | If I've got all of my stuff in a database, wouldn't it be handy if I could securely share it with the rest of the family so they can search it too without always asking me where something is located?

      h2.title.is-5 I just love building stuff

      p
        | Unhappy with the status quo, I started to build out Thingybase to what it is today. I found it so useful and the use cases so compelling that I decided to open it up to the world so I could share it with my family and friends.

      p
        | I don't just work on Thingybase because it makes my life betterâ€”I get to share the fun! See the stick figures all over? Those were inspired by my eldest daughter's preschool artwork. If they don't make you smile, even just a little bit, then I don't know what will.

      p
        | You'll find other little touches all over. Dark mode works great, even for illustrations. It's fast. It's private. Each time I make an improvement and deploy, it feels like I'm chipping away at this problem and making peoples' lives just a tiny bit more manageable and less stressful.

      p Cheers,
