When you cook big batches of food to stash away in the deep freezer for an easy meal later, Thingybase can help manage all the inventory so waste less of it.

## What you need

You'll need the following to get started:

* [A Thingybase account](/launch)
* [Thermal label printer](/help/printers)
* [Deep freezer](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=deep+freezer)
* Freezer safe containers or bags

## How to do it

You already have a deep dreezer plugged in and probably full of food. Ideally you're reusing old food containers, like cottage cheese or large yougurt containers, to reduce plastic waste. Make sure your [thermal label printer](/help/printers) is plugged in and working on your network; you'll be printing labels with it from your phone or computer.

Alright, lets get to it.

### Create "Deep freezer"

First, find or create the room in your [Thingybase account items](/launch/items) where your deep freezer is located. Click `+ Add item`, enter the name "Deep freezer", and check the `Allow items to be contained within this item` checkbox. Next click `Create item`, which saves it to your account. If you want, click `More...`, `Change icon` and select the freezer so it stands out a bit more.

### Add items to the deep freezer

Once you've created the deep freezer in Thingybase, it's time to start adding all the food you want to inventory. From the deep freezer, click `+ Add item`, `Choose from template...`, `Perishable`. Then enter the name of the item, an expiration date (you can free form it, like "6 months from now" or "next March"), and pick an icon if you'd like. When you're all done, click `Create Item`.
