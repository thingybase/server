Nothing beats cooking in a well organized kitchen. Build out a spice rack that fits perfectly in your cabinets with labels that you can quickly read while cooking.

## What you need

You'll need the following to get started:

* [A Thingybase account](/launch)
* [Thermal label printer](/help/printers)
* Your favorite [mason jars](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mason+jars)
* 2x4 and 4x4 boards
* Wood saw to cut boards (a handsaw will do)
* Tape measure
* Pencil
* Clamps to hold boards while cutting

## How to do it

With a little bit of planning and some time, you can make some great spice racks to put in your cabinets to keep your spices organized and easy to read that are way better than the cheap plastic spice rack stands you buy from the store.

### Put spices in jars and label

Take all of your spices and put them into the jars. Using Thingybase, print lables for each spice that you want to see while you're cooking.

### Measure cabinets

You'll need to measure the width and depth of the cabinets. The width will tell you how long of a board to cut and the depth will tell you how many boards you can fit side-by-side in the cabinet. Measure the width of your cabinets with the tape measure.

### Cut boards

Cut the 2x4 and 4x4's to the length that matches the width for your cabinet.

### Fit boards into cabinets

Now that the boards are cut, you'll have to make sure the boards fit into the cabinets. You might have to angle the board at first to get it into the cabinet or shimmy it around. If it doesn't fit, you might have to cut the board to be shorter than the width of the cabinets. It's OK if its a little bit shorter than the width of the cabinet; there's still going to be plenty of room to spread out the spice jars.

First you'll wiggle the 4x4 into place so its in the back of the shelf. Then wiggle in the 2x4.

### Put jars on boards

When the boards are placed properly in the cabinets, put the jars on the boards, then take a picture of it and admire your work. If you want to make your friends a little bit jealous, share the picture on Instagram and show off your newly organize pantry.

## One more thing

If your cabinets are deep enough, you could get a 2x6 or stack the 4x4 on top of the 2x4 to have a 4th row for the spices. That's a whole lot of spices!
