## How to do it

With a little bit of planning and some time, you can make some great spice racks to put in your cabinets to keep your spices organized and easy to read.

### Put spices in jars and label

### Measure cabinets

You'll need to measure the width and depth of the cabinets. The width will tell you how long of a board to cut and the depth will tell you how many boards you can fit side-by-side in the cabinet. Measure the width of your cabinets with the tape measure.

### Cut boards

Cut the 2x4 and 4x4's to the length that matches the width for your cabinet.

### Fit boards into cabinets

Now that the boards are cut, you'll have to make sure the boards fit into the cabinets. You might have to angle the board at first to get it into the cabinet or wiggle it around. If it doesn't fit, you might have to cut the board to be shorter than the width of the cabinets.

First you'll wiggle the 4x4 into place so its in the back of the shelf. Then wiggle in the 2x4.
