There's an art to labeling stuff; if you make too many labels, it becomes a burden to maintain. If you make too few, it becomes difficult to find things. In just a few minutes this will help you get a better idea of how much labeling feels right.

## What you need

You'll need the following to get started:

* [A Thingybase account](/launch)
* [Thermal label printer](/help/printers)
* Cabinets, drawers, and dressers that need to be organized

## How to do it

We all have places in our homes that are great for storing stuff, but difficult or awkward to reach maybe because they're stored up high in a closet or cabinet and need a stool to access. When you print magic labels with Thingybase, you can simply scan the label without getting out a stool to see what's inside.

### Crates in a closet

Often times there's some shelves up high in closets that are a great place to store things that are not frequently used, but a huge pain to take down, dig through, and find whatever it is you're looking for. With Thingybase labels, you can walk into the closet, take out your phone, hold it up to the camera, scan the label, and see what's inside.

To get this setup, find or create the room your closet is in from the [items](/launch/items) in Thingybase. Tap `Add item`, enter `Closet`, check the `Allow items to be contained within this item. For boxes, shelves, folders, or anything used to organize items.` box, then press the `Create Item` button. You should now be viewing the Closet item.

Press the `Add item` button, the enter the name of the items you're keeping in the dresser like `Queen Sheets`, then check `Allow items to be contained within this item. For boxes, shelves, folders, or anything used to organize items.`. When you're all done, [print the labels](/help/printers) and adhere them to the crates and put them back up high. Be careful!

### Organize a dresser

First, find the room your dresser is in from your [items](/launch/items) in Thingybase, then tap `Add item`, enter `Dresser`, check the `Allow items to be contained within this item. For boxes, shelves, folders, or anything used to organize items.` box, then press the `Create Item` button. You should now be viewing the Dresser item. Press the `Add item` button, the enter the name of the items you're keeping in the dresser like `Socks`. Repeat this for each type of item you have in your dresser like `Shirts`, `Belts`, `Shorts`, `Jeans`, `Undershirts`, `Pajamas`, etc. until you've got everything mapped out that you want to label. When you're all done, [print the labels](/help/printers) and adhere them to the drawers. When it's all done, it looks like this:

Why bother? If you want your laundry put back in your dresser a certain way, you're more likely to do it when you see the labels. If you're lucky enough to have somebody else do your laundry for you, they'll know exactly where to put your clothes so you can find them.

### You get the idea

By now you can see how Thingybase can help make finding stuff easier that's difficult to access. All you need is a [label printer](/help/printers), a little bit of time, and of course a [Thingybase account](/launch).
