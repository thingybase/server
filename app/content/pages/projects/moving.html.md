Moving can be stressfulâ€”the last thing you need to worry about is where all of your stuff is. When everything is packed in boxes, you shouldn't have to open them all to find what you're looking for. Thingybase gives you peace of mind while you move your stuff, and if you need something when you get to the other side, you can search for it on your phone and find it quickly.

## What you need

You'll need the following to get started:

* [A Thingybase account](/launch)
* [Thermal label printer](/help/printers)
* A bunch of boxes or crates

## How to do it

The worst part about moving is when you need to find something and its all packed into boxes. This project runs you through how you can use Thingybase to print labels that you can see clearly before, during, and after the move to make finding stuff easier that you can even search for from your phone.

Let's get started, there's a lot of work ahead.

### Start a move from the dashboard

[Log in to Thingybase](/launch/move) click `Start a move`. Follow the instructions to create a move until you end up on the moving dashboard.

### Pack boxes

Now the fun part! Carefully pack your boxes, but don't tape them shut until you start making labels so you can see whats inside when you create the label. Make sure you don't pack your printers and WiFi network until the very end.

### Print labels

Once you pack a few boxes its time to create a label. Click or tap `Create moving label` from the [Moving dashboard](/launch/move), enter the contents of the box you packed so you can search for it later, the select the destination.

The destination is where you want the movers to put your box when they get to the new place. If you don't see the destination you want, create it from [items](/launch/items) and go through this step again.

When everything looks good, click or tap the `Create Movement` button and you'll see the moving label. If everything looks good click or tap `Print` and print to your label printer from the system print dialog.

Rinse and repeat for all the boxes you pack. When it's all done you'll be able to see everything you're moving from the [Moving dashboard](/launch/move).

### Load the moving truck

Don't forget to pack your printer! On the day of the move, the movers or you can load up the truck with all the boxes.

### Unload the moving truck and scan all the boxes

When the movers get all the boxes in the room, you can scan them in with your phone's QR code scanner to make sure they're all there. If there's a few missing ones then its time to go looking around to see if you can find the box or item.

### Finish the move

By now you can see how Thingybase can help make finding stuff easier that's difficult to access. All you need is a [label printer](/help/printers), a little bit of time, and of course a [Thingybase account](/launch).
